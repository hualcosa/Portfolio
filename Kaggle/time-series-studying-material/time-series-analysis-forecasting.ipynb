Important Terms to understand for Time Series Analysis \n\nA Time-Series is a sequence of data points collected at different timestamps. These are essentially successive measurements collected from the same data source at the same time interval. Further, we can use these chronologically gathered readings to monitor trends and changes over time. The time-series models can be univariate or multivariate. The univariate time series models are implemented when the dependent variable is a single time series, like room temperature measurement from a single sensor. On the other hand, a multivariate time series model can be used when there are multiple dependent variables, i.e., the output depends on more than one series. An example for the multivariate time-series model could be modelling the GDP, inflation, and unemployment together as these variables are linked to each other.\n\n### 1. Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series\n**Stationarity is a property of a time series.** A stationary series is one where the values of the series is not a function of time. That is, the statistical properties of the series like mean, variance and autocorrelation are constant over time. Autocorrelation of the series is nothing but the correlation of the series with its previous values, more on this coming up. **A stationary time series id devoid of seasonal effects as well.**\n\n### 2. Trend\nThe trend shows a general direction of the time series data over a long period of time. A trend can be increasing(upward), decreasing(downward), or horizontal(stationary).\n\n### 3.Seasonality \nThe seasonality component exhibits a trend that repeats with respect to timing, direction, and magnitude. Some examples include an increase in water consumption in summer due to hot weather conditions.\n\n### 4. Cyclical Component\nThese are the trends with no set repetition over a particular period of time. A cycle refers to the period of ups and downs, booms and slums of a time series, mostly observed in business cycles. These cycles do not exhibit a seasonal variation but generally occur over a time period of 3 to 12 years depending on the nature of the time series.\n\n###  5. Irregular Variation \nThese are the fluctuations in the time series data which become evident when trend and cyclical variations are removed. These variations are unpredictable, erratic, and may or may not be random.\n\n###  6. ETS Decomposition\nETS Decomposition is used to separate different components of a time series. The term ETS stands for Error, Trend and Seasonality.\n\n###  7. Dependence\nIt refers to the association of two observations of the same variable at prior time periods.\n\n###  8. Differencing\nDifferencing is used to make the series stationary and to control the auto-correlations. There may be some cases in time series analyses where we do not require differencing and over-differenced series can produce wrong estimates.\n\n###  9. Specification \nIt may involve the testing of the linear or non-linear relationships of dependent variables by using time series models such as ARIMA models.\n\n###  10. ARIMA \nARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Time_Series_Analysis_In_Python_3.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:20px;color:black;margin:0;font-size:250%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:5px;background-color:#aaf0f0;overflow:hidden;font-weight:700;border: 5px solid #21a3a3;\"> üìã Helpful Libraries in Python for Time Series</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üìã 3.

Hence, this library is mainly used for feature engineering in time series problems and other packages like sklearn to analyze the time series.\n\n- ### **2) Darts**\nDarts is another time series Python library developed by Unit8 for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series. This idea was to make darts as simple to use as sklearn for time-series. Darts attempts to smooth the overall process of using time series in machine learning. Darts has two models: Regression models (predicts output with time as input) and Forecasting models (predicts future output based on past values).\n\n- ### **3)  Kats**\nKats (Kits to Analyze Time Series) is an open-source Python library developed by researchers at Facebook (now Meta). This library is easy to use and is helpful for time series problems. This is due to its very light weighted library of generic time series analysis which allows to set up the models quicker without spending so much time processing time series and calculations in different models.\n\n- ### **4) GreyKite**\nGreyKite is a time-series forecasting library released by LinkedIn to simplify prediction for data scientists. This library offers automation in forecasting tasks using the primary forecasting algorithm ‚ÄòSilverkite.‚Äô This library also helps interpret outputs making it a go-to tool for most time-series forecasting projects.\n\n- ### **5) AutoTS**\nAutoTS, another Python time series tool, stands for Automatic Time Series, quickly providing high-accuracy forecasts at scale. It offers many different forecasting models and functions directly compatible with pandas‚Äô data frames. The models from this library can be used for deployment. Some noticeable features of this library are ‚Äì it works well with both univariate and multivariate time series data, it can handle missing or messy data with outliers, it helps to identify the best time series forecasting model based on the input data type","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:20px;color:black;margin:0;font-size:250%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:5px;background-color:#aaf0f0;overflow:hidden;font-weight:700;border: 5px solid #21a3a3;\"> üìá Data and Modules</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üìá 4.

If the stats are quite different, then the series is not likely to be stationary.\n\nNevertheless, you need a method to quantitatively determine if a given series is stationary or not. This can be done using statistical tests called ‚ÄòUnit Root Tests‚Äô. There are multiple variations of this, where the tests check if a time series is non-stationary and possess a unit root.\n\nThere are multiple implementations of Unit Root tests like:\n- Augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADH Test)\n- Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin ‚Äì KPSS test (trend stationary)\n- Philips Perron test (PP Test)\n\nThe most commonly used is the ADF test, where the null hypothesis is the time series possesses a unit root and is non-stationary.

In other words, autocorrelation is intended to measure the relationship between a variable's present value and any past values that you may have access to.\n\nWhen regression is performed on time series data, the errors may not be independent. Often errors are autocorrelated; that is, each error is correlated with the error immediately before it. Autocorrelation is also a symptom of systematic lack of fit. The DW option provides the Durbin-Watson d statistic to test that the autocorrelation is zero:\nd = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=2}^n (e_i - e_{i-1})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2} \nThe value of d is close to 2 if the errors are uncorrelated. The distribution of d is reported by Durbin and Watson (1951). Tables of the distribution are found in most econometrics textbooks, such as Johnston (1972) and Pindyck and Rubinfeld (1981).\n\nThe sample autocorrelation estimate is displayed after the Durbin-Watson statistic.

Negative autocorrelation of the errors generally tends to make the estimate of the error variance too large, so confidence intervals are too wide and the power of significance tests is reduced. With either positive or negative autocorrelation, least-squares parameter estimates are usually not as efficient as generalized least-squares parameter estimates.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Autocorrelation is the correlation between two observations at different points in a time series. For example, values that are separated by an interval might have a strong positive or negative correlation. When these correlations are present, they indicate that past values influence the current value. Analysts use the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions to understand the properties of time series data, fit the appropriate models, and make forecasts.\n\nIn this post, I cover both the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function. You‚Äôll learn about the differences between these functions and what they can tell you about your data. In later posts, I‚Äôll show you how to incorporate this information in regression models of time series data and other time-series analyses.\n\n#### Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Basics\nAutocorrelation is the correlation between two values in a time series. In other words, the time series data correlate with themselves‚Äîhence, the name. We talk about these correlations using the term ‚Äúlags.‚Äù Analysts record time-series data by measuring a characteristic at evenly spaced intervals‚Äîsuch as daily, monthly, or yearly. The number of intervals between the two observations is the lag. For example, the lag between the current and previous observation is one. If you go back one more interval, the lag is two, and so on.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the observations at yt and yt‚Äìk are separated by k time units. K is the lag. This lag can be days, quarters, or years depending on the nature of the data. When k=1, you‚Äôre assessing adjacent observations. For each lag, there is a correlation.\n\n#### Autocorrelation Function (ACF)\nUse the autocorrelation function (ACF) to identify which lags have significant correlations, understand the patterns and properties of the time series, and then use that information to model the time series data. From the ACF, you can assess the randomness and stationarity of a time series. You can also determine whether trends and seasonal patterns are present.\n\nIn an ACF plot, each bar represents the size and direction of the correlation. Bars that extend across the red line are statistically significant.\n\n#### Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)\nThe partial autocorrelation function is similar to the ACF except that it displays only the correlation between two observations that the shorter lags between those observations do not explain. For example, the partial autocorrelation for lag 3 is only the correlation that lags 1 and 2 do not explain. In other words, the partial correlation for each lag is the unique correlation between those two observations after partialling out the intervening correlations.\n\nAs you saw, the autocorrelation function helps assess the properties of a time series. In contrast, the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is more useful during the specification process for an autoregressive model. Analysts use partial autocorrelation plots to specify regression models with time series data and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. I‚Äôll focus on that aspect in posts about those methods.\n\n*https://statisticsbyjim.com/time-series/autocorrelation-partial-autocorrelation/*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import acf, pacf\nfrom statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf\n\ndf = train[(train['country']=='Belgium')&(train['product']=='Kaggle Advanced Techniques')&(train['store']=='KaggleMart')]\ndf['value']=df['num_sold']\n\nacf_50 = acf(df.value, nlags=50)\npacf_50 = pacf(df.value, nlags=50)\n\n# Draw Plot\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(16,3), dpi= 100)\nplot_acf(df.value.tolist(), lags=50, ax=axes[0])\nplot_pacf(df.value.tolist(), lags=50, ax=axes[1])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-30T05:29:51.664231Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-30T05:29:51.664819Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-30T05:29:52.529644Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-30T05:29:51.664784Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-30T05:29:52.528573Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:20px;color:black;margin:0;font-size:250%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:5px;background-color:#aaf0f0;overflow:hidden;font-weight:700;border: 5px solid #21a3a3;\"> üìñ Lag plots</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üìñ 13.

As the dataset provides counts by month, a window size of 12 will give us the annual rolling average.\n\nWe will also include the rolling standard deviation to see how much the data varies from the rolling average.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:20px;color:black;margin:0;font-size:250%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:5px;background-color:#aaf0f0;overflow:hidden;font-weight:700;border: 5px solid #21a3a3;\">  üìí Pros and Cons</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#  üìí 20. Pros and Cons\n\n## Pros of ARIMA & SARIMA\n- **Easy to understand and interpret:** The one thing that your fellow teammates and colleagues would appreciate is the simplicity and interpretability of the models. Focusing on both of these things while also maintaining the quality of the results will help with presentations with the stakeholders.\n- **Limited variables:** There are fewer hyperparameters so the config file will be easily maintainable if the model goes into production.\n\n## Cons of ARIMA & SARIMA\n- **Exponential time complexity:** When the value of p and q increases there are equally more coefficients to fit hence increasing the time complexity manifold if p and q are high. This makes both of these algorithms hard to put into production and makes Data Scientists look into Prophet and other algorithms. Then again, it depends on the complexity of the dataset too.\n- **Complex data:** There can be a possibility where your data is too complex and there is no optimal solution for p and q. Although highly unlikely that ARIMA and SARIMA would fail but if this occurs then unfortunately you may have to look elsewhere.\n- **Amount of data needed:** Both the algorithms require considerable data to work on, especially if the data is seasonal. For example, using three years of historical demand is likely not to be enough (Short Life-Cycle Products) for a good forecast.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:20px;color:black;margin:0;font-size:250%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:5px;background-color:#aaf0f0;overflow:hidden;font-weight:700;border: 5px solid #21a3a3;\"> üìì References</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üìì 21.

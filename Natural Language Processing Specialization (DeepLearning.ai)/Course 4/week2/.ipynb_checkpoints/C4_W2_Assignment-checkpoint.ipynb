    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment of course 4. In this assignment you will explore summarization using the transformer model. Yes, you will implement the transformer decoder from scratch, but we will slowly walk you through it. There are many hints in this notebook so feel free to use them as needed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp/supplement/shBOS/how-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

    "Summarization is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful for a consumer enterprise. For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then you can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks. Anyways who wants to read an article or a long email today, when you can build a transformer to summarize text for you. Let's get started, by completing this assignment you will learn to:  \n",
